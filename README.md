# FibonacciSequenceConsoleAppilcation

#This application is a test for a company

#Application excepts two non-negative numbers consecutive fibonacci numbers

#Application checks if the numbers are not postive 

#Application also checks if the given numbers are not Fibonacci numbers

#Application also asks for a maximum number, so for example if you want to start with 1,1 and want to go until 13 you can type 5 as maximum. so the program will calculate the next 5 fibonacci numbers

#Application has some unit tests attached to it

#Improvements

# 1. We can check that the two numbers given are actully consecutive fibonacci numbers
